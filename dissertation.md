# Dissertation Summary

<p align="justify">What are the causes and consequences of opinion language within the U.S. federal judiciary? The burgeoning literature on judicial opinion writing has found evidence of language borrowing, strategic opinion formation, and consequences for bureaucratic implementation. Still, this scholarship has not coalesced toward an overarching understanding of judicial writing. My dissertation takes advantage of this scholarly void by identifying the opportunities and constraints that judges face in crafting their opinions. Across three separate applications, I argue that federal circuit court judges are highly strategic in their opinion language. That is to say that judges consider, first, hierarchical and horizontal constraints, and second, how opinions lead to particular downstream consequences. To achieve this, I collected over 60,000 U.S. circuit court opinions (2000-2010), which I utilize for text analysis to generate measures of writing characteristics. Then, in the first chapter, I examine how circuit judges write their opinions strategically, especially concerning Supreme Court preferences. Second, I develop writing scores for U.S. circuit judges, from which I examine deviations in style given collegial interactions. Third, I study the impact of judges’ opinions on how street-level bureaucrats implement legal rules.</p>

# Chapter 1

"Strategic Opinion Language on the U.S. Courts of Appeals." Conditionally accepted at *Journal of Law & Courts*. 

<p align="justify">What strategies do judges employ when they anticipate review? Constrained judges behave strategically by using particular instruments – like language complexity – when authoring opinions. Prior studies suggest judges use complexity in anticipation of legislative hostility. Similarly, the threat of review and reversal may spur opinion complexity. This study examines variations in circuit court opinions resulting from precedent treatment and Supreme Court preferences. When a circuit negatively treats a Supreme Court precedent that the justices prefer or a circuit positively treats a precedent the justices dislike, opinion complexity should increase. These hypotheses find support, suggesting that circuits strategically insulate using opinion complexity.</p>


# Chapter 2

"Collegial Politics and Opinion Writing on the U.S. Courts of Appeals."

<p align="justify">How do circuit judges accommodate ideologically distant colleagues? Extant research suggests that potential whistle-blowers and minority-representative judges can moderate the decisions of circuit panel majorities. This research looks to circuit opinion language to identify a different form of panel effects and consensus-building. After identifying writing style scores for all Courts of Appeals judges from 2000 to 2010, this study assesses whether a panel's ideological heterogeneity leads to deviations from a judge's writing habits. Empirical estimations provide evidence that judges accommodate their colleagues through their opinion language. </p>
