<p align="justify">Dissertation summary: What are the causes and consequences of opinion language within the U.S. federal judiciary? The burgeoning scholarship on judicial opinion writing has found evidence of language borrowing, strategic opinion formation, and consequences for bureaucratic implementation. Still, the literature has not coalesced toward an overarching understanding of judges' writing as a fundamental element of judicial behavior akin to judges' preferences. In the same way that a judge's ideology motivates her dispositions across a set of cases, so too does a judge's writing style have broad implications for litigants, bureaucrats, and policy-makers, among many others. My dissertation takes advantage of this scholarly void in three distinct ways. First, I examine how judges write their opinions strategically, especially concerning hierarchical constraints. Second, I develop writing scores for U.S. federal judges who served between 2000 and 2010, from which I examine deviations in style given collegial interactions. Third, I study the impact of judges’ opinions on how street-level bureaucrats implement legal rules.</p>

<p align="justify">What strategies do judges employ when they anticipate review? Constrained judges behave strategically by using particular instruments – like language complexity – when authoring opinions. Prior studies suggest judges use complexity in anticipation of legislative hostility. Similarly, the threat of review and reversal may spur opinion complexity. This study examines variations in circuit court opinions resulting from precedent treatment and Supreme Court preferences. When a circuit negatively treats a Supreme Court precedent that the justices prefer or a circuit positively treats a precedent the justices dislike, opinion complexity should increase. These hypotheses find support, suggesting that circuits strategically insulate using opinion complexity.</p>
