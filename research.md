<p align="justify">I am most passionate about researching law and courts, primarily in the American politics subfield, but also in comparative contexts. While my dissertation focuses on opinion writing in U.S. federal courts, I have many other judicial related interests, including legal doctrine/precedent treatment, agenda setting, and judicial confirmation politics. Aside from these particular interests, I am involved in various other projects studying the American president, judicial independence, and mass opinion/polarization.</p>

<p align="justify">All of my research -- including my dissertation -- is made better by my colleagues and co-authors. I hope you will take some time to check out some of their websites, which I am including here.
