### <a name="complexity"></a>Boston, Joshua. "Strategic Opinion Language on the U.S. Courts of Appeals." *Under Review*
What strategies do judges employ when they anticipate review? Constrained judges behave strategically by using particular instruments -- like language complexity -- when authoring opinions. Prior studies suggest judges use complexity in anticipation of legislative hostility. Similarly, the threat of review and reversal may spur opinion complexity. This study examines variations in circuit court opinions resulting from precedent treatment and Supreme Court preferences. When a circuit negatively treats a Supreme Court precedent that the justices prefer or a circuit positively treats a precedent the justices dislike, opinion complexity should increase. These hypotheses find support, suggesting that circuits strategically insulate using opinion complexity.

"Political Competition and Judicial Independence: How Courts Fill the Void When Legislatures Are Ineffective."
Extant studies illuminate the impact of political competition on policy-makers' motivation to create *de jure* independent judiciaries. Still, less is certain about whether competition might also impact *de facto* independence. We show with a formal model that political competition reduces legislators' ability to address policy-seekers' proposals, causing increased demand for policy intervention from the courts. Utilizing a large sample of democratic states over time, we estimate the relationship between competition and *de facto* independence using a multilevel model. Across model specifications, we consistently find support for our theory, which has important implications for our conceptions of the nature of judicial independence; it is not simply the practice of autonomous judicial behavior, but a function of the current political environment.

"Casualties of the Culture Wars: Lifestyle Differences Between Democrats and Republicans."
Do our basic daily choices—from the comics we read to the sports we play—segregate us into distinct partisan communities? Using answers to almost 300 questions from over 1300 respondents in a United States national probability sample survey on lifestyle choices (rang- ing from recreational activities to food preferences), we ascertain whether American lifestyles are partitioned by political party. Relying upon a community detection algorithm and latent class analysis, we demonstrate that American lifestyles are divided into two communities and the greatest predictor of membership is partisanship, even when controlling for race, gender, age, income, and education. We find that this clustering with respect to lifestyles dampens political discussion across citizens.
