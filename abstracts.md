### <a name="complexity"></a>Boston, Joshua. "Strategic Opinion Language on the U.S. Courts of Appeals." *Under Review*
What strategies do judges employ when they anticipate review? Constrained judges behave strategically by using particular instruments -- like language complexity -- when authoring opinions. Prior studies suggest judges use complexity in anticipation of legislative hostility. Similarly, the threat of review and reversal may spur opinion complexity. This study examines variations in circuit court opinions resulting from precedent treatment and Supreme Court preferences. When a circuit negatively treats a Supreme Court precedent that the justices prefer or a circuit positively treats a precedent the justices dislike, opinion complexity should increase. These hypotheses find support, suggesting that circuits strategically insulate using opinion complexity.

Neiheisel</a>. "Power Plus Persuasion: The Anatomy of Kennedy’s Housing Order." *Under Review*
We examine the influence of various political actors on the substance and timing of presidential orders and, thus, on presidential leadership. Specifically, we analyze President Kennedy’s decision to issue E. O. 11063, which directed the federal bureaucracy to eliminate discrimination in the sale or lease of residential property and related facilities owned or assisted by the federal government. However, this order did not result solely from Kennedy’s personal political views or policy preferences; to the contrary, this exercise of presidential power was largely a product of persuasion by several political actors who coaxed Kennedy to take action—White House advisers, bureaucrats at the Housing and Home Finance Administration, the deputy assistant attorney general, officials at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, leading civil rights interest groups, and members of the news media. At the same time, housing order opponents on Capitol Hill exerted pressure on Kennedy that, when combined with foreign policy issues, slowed the issuance of the order for nearly two years and weakened its content. Overall, though, Kennedy successfully exercised leadership during this time, as he balanced the need for a housing order with pressing international and domestic priorities. This suggests that presidential actions on specific policy questions, such as housing segregation, cannot be viewed and assessed in a vacuum because the exercise of the president’s formal power of the pen is often conditioned by concerns over the informal political costs of unilateral executive action.

"Political Competition and Judicial Independence: How Courts Fill the Void When Legislatures Are Ineffective."
Extant studies illuminate the impact of political competition on policy-makers' motivation to create *de jure* independent judiciaries. Still, less is certain about whether competition might also impact *de facto* independence. We show with a formal model that political competition reduces legislators' ability to address policy-seekers' proposals, causing increased demand for policy intervention from the courts. Utilizing a large sample of democratic states over time, we estimate the relationship between competition and *de facto* independence using a multilevel model. Across model specifications, we consistently find support for our theory, which has important implications for our conceptions of the nature of judicial independence; it is not simply the practice of autonomous judicial behavior, but a function of the current political environment.

"Casualties of the Culture Wars: Lifestyle Differences Between Democrats and Republicans."
Do our basic daily choices—from the comics we read to the sports we play—segregate us into distinct partisan communities? Using answers to almost 300 questions from over 1300 respondents in a United States national probability sample survey on lifestyle choices (rang- ing from recreational activities to food preferences), we ascertain whether American lifestyles are partitioned by political party. Relying upon a community detection algorithm and latent class analysis, we demonstrate that American lifestyles are divided into two communities and the greatest predictor of membership is partisanship, even when controlling for race, gender, age, income, and education. We find that this clustering with respect to lifestyles dampens political discussion across citizens.

Lamb</a>, Joshua Boston. "Presidential Rhetoric and Bureaucratic Enforcement: Evidence from the Clinton Administration."
Focusing on the Clinton years, we examine two indicators of presidential leadership in fair housing: Clinton’s public statements and the degree of fair housing enforcement by HUD and DOJ under his appointees. However, even though research concludes that presidential signals affect bureaucratic behavior, our analysis reveals few indications of leadership. We would therefore expect that when a president sends weak signals, weak bureaucratic enforcement would be the result, regardless of a president’s policy reputation. Overall, our findings augment existing work on presidential opinion leadership by expanding the scope of inquiry and demonstrating that the intensity of presidential statements matter.
