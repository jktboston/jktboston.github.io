<p align="justify">Teaching is something that excites me, as I enjoy working with students, and I find that classroom discussions often lead to promising research questions. Across three universities, I have independently taught six introductory and advanced undergraduate courses. As a graduate instructor at the University at Buffalo (SUNY), I taught constitutional law, civil liberties, and the American presidency. While an adjunct instructor at SUNY Buffalo State College, I taught large lecture-style classes covering introductory topics in American and comparative politics. At WashU, I twice led a semester-long teaching pedagogy workshop for undergraduate teaching assistants, who were charged with leading recitation sections for Prof. Andrew Reeves' Introduction to American Politics lecture. Finally, I have TA'd for 15 different courses across public law/judicial politics, American politics, and methods.

Please <a href="https://graduate.artsci.wustl.edu/boston/contact" target="_blank">contact me</a> for any syllabi. Unfortunately, I only have course evaluations available for my Washington University teaching assistant experience. The University at Buffalo did not collect teaching evaluations for graduate instructors during summer terms. SUNY Buffalo State College utilized paper evaluations in spring 2013, but they have recently transitioned to an online-only system.
