<p align="justify">Teaching is something that excites me! I enjoy working with students. I do my best to make myself as available as possible for research, mentoring, discussions about career path/graduate school, extracurricular advising, and personal/community-building conversations. I find that in-class discussions often lead to promising research questions both for me and my students. I enjoy teaching introductory and advanced courses across American politics topics, with a strong focus on law & courts.</p>

During the summer months, Prof. Boston is available for virtual meetings scheduled at our mutual convenience. 

If you cannot make it to office hours or you need to have a more detailed meeting, you can schedule it by <a href="mailto:jboston@bgsu.edu" target="_blank">emailing Prof. Boston.</a>

During the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 academic years, I completed the BGSU Teaching and Learning Certificate Program as part of the Center for Faculty Excellence.
