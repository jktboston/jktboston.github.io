<p>Josh and his wife, Kaitlin, were born and raised in western New York. After living in the Buffalo-Niagara region for seven years, they relocated to St. Louis in 2013. They lived in the Delmar Loop for six years. While Josh worked on his PhD at Washington University, <a href="https://www.kaitlinboston.com/" target="_blank">Kaitlin</a> worked as special education teacher in north St. Louis County, where she focused students with autism. They are the proud parents of two Saint Louisan boys: Charles and Arthur. They also have a dog, Lucie, who is a terrier with a lot of attitude. In summer 2019, they relocated to Toledo, Ohio---a city they are loving to learn and explore.</p>
  
  
<p>While parenting takes up most of Josh and Kaitlin's free time, they also enjoy traveling, hiking, skiing, cycling, going to the beach, watching college sports (Go Blue!), and cooking (and eating) great food. They are members of both the Saint Louis and Toledo Zoos. The Bostons were previously parishioners of Our Lady of Lourdes in University City, MO.</p>
