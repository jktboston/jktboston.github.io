Josh and his wife, Kaitlin, are originally from western New York. After living in Buffalo for seven years, they relocated to Saint Louis in July 2013. They are the proud parents of Charles, who was born in May 2017, and their dog, Lucie, a Glen of Imaal Terrier who has a lot of attitude. The Bostons enjoy long walks and dog park visits in University City's Loop neighborhood. While parenting takes up most of Josh and Kaitlin's time, they also enjoy staying up to date on politics (even in his spare time), traveling, hiking, watching sports, and cooking great food (especially Italian, French, Mexican, and Polish classics). Kaitlin teaches children with autism in north Saint Louis County. They are proud members of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish in University City, Missouri.
