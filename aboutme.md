<p>Josh and his wife, Kaitlin, are originally from western New York. After living in Buffalo for seven years, they relocated to St. Louis in July 2013. Kaitlin is a special education teacher in north St. Louis County, where she works in a dedicated classroom for students with autism. They are the proud parents of Charles, who was born in 2017. They also have a loving dog, Lucie, who is a terrier with a lot of attitude. The Bostons enjoy long walks in University City's Loop neighborhood. While parenting takes up most of Josh and Kaitlin's free time, they also enjoy traveling, hiking, watching sports, and cooking (and eating) great food.</p>
