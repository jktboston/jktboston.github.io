Josh and his wife, Kaitlin, are originally from western New York. After living in Buffalo for seven years, they relocated to Saint Louis in July 2013. They are the proud parents of a Glen of Imaal Terrier, Lucie, and they are expecting a baby boy in May 2017. The Bostons enjoy long walks and dog park visits in University City's Loop neighborhood. While Josh enjoys studying and reading about politics (even in his spare time), he also enjoys traveling, hiking, watching and playing sports, watching movies, and eating great food. Kaitlin teaches children with severe autism in north Saint Louis County. In her spare time, Kaitlin enjoys traveling, camping, wine tasting, cooking (especially Italian, French, & Mexican classics), and humoring her husband while watching sports.
