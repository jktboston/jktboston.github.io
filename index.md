# [About Me](https://www.joshuaboston.com/cv/)

<p align="justify">My name is Joshua Boston, and I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/political-science.html" target="_blank">Bowling Green State University political science department</a>. My research focuses on American politics, focusing on the behavioral implications of political institutions. My <a href="http://www.joshuaboston.com/research/" target="_blank">research</a> and <a href="http://www.joshuaboston.com/teaching/" target="_blank">teaching</a> center on judicial politics &mdash; examining questions of elite decisionmaking, separation of powers, and public support for courts. I have additional interests in questions that study separation of powers, the American presidency, and comparative courts. I earned my Ph.D. in political science at <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. Previously, I attended the University at Buffalo (SUNY) where I earned an M.A. in political science and B.A. in legal studies (<i>summa cum laude</i>, &Phi;&Beta;&Kappa;).</p>
