# [About Me](http://www.joshuaboston.com/aboutme/)

<p align="justify">Hello! My name Joshua Boston, and I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in Saint Louis</a>. My research focuses on judicial politics in the American context, though I have additional interests in American political institutions and comparative courts. Before coming to St. Louis, I earned my B.A. (SCL, ΦΒΚ) in legal studies at the University at Buffalo, where I later earned my M.A. in political science.</p>
  
# [Research Interests](http://www.joshuaboston.com/research/) 

<p align="justify">My primary research interests are related to law & courts. My dissertation studies the causes and consequences of judges' opinion writing within the U.S. federal judiciary. Additionally, I am interested in questions regarding legal doctrine/precedent treatment, agenda setting, and judicial confirmation politics. Aside from these particular interests, I am involved in various other projects studying the American president, comparative courts, and mass opinion/polarization.</p>
  
# [Dissertation](http://www.joshuaboston.com/dissertation/)

<p align="justify">In my dissertation, I analyze judicial writing in three distict contexts, with the overarching goal of identifying opinion writing as a fundamental element of judicial behavior akin to policy preferences. I am interested in using new and established measures of writing characteristics to develop an overarching understanding of how judges write given certain constraints and how judges' opinions lead to particular policy outcomes.</p>
