# [About Me](https://www.joshuaboston.com/aboutme/)

<p align="justify">My name Joshua Boston, and I am an assistant professor in the Bowling Green State University political science department. In 2019, I earned my Ph.D. in political science at <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. My research focuses on American political institutions, with a strong emphasis on judicial politics. I have additional interests in questions that study separation of powers, the American presidency, and comparative courts. Before coming to WashU, I earned an M.A. in political science at the University at Buffalo (SUNY), where I also earned my B.A. (SCL, ΦΒΚ).</p>
  
# [Research Interests](https://www.joshuaboston.com/research/) 

<p align="justify">My primary interests are related to law & courts, both in the American and comparative contexts. Much of my research focuses on the language judges choose to resolve disputes. In this vein, my dissertation focused on the the causes and consequences of judges' opinion writing on U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals. Additionally, I am interested in questions regarding legal doctrine/precedent treatment, agenda setting, and judicial confirmation politics. Aside from these particular interests, I am involved in various other projects studying the American president, comparative courts, and mass opinion/polarization.</p>

# [Teaching](https://www.joshuaboston.com/teaching//)
  
<p align="justify">Teaching is something that excites me, as I enjoy working with students, and I find that classroom discussions often lead to promising research questions both for myself and my students. I enjoy teaching introductory and advanced courses across American politics topics, with a strong focus on law & courts.</p>
