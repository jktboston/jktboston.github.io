<p align="justify">Hi! I am Jonathan Homola, a graduate student in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. I am a political methodologist and a comparativist. My substantive research interests include party competition, representation, political behavior, the role of women in politics, and immigration. My regional areas of expertise are Western democracies and Eastern Europe. Methodologically, I am interested in Bayesian research methods, survival models, survey methodology, and causal inference. My work across these different fields has lead to multiple <a href="http://jhomola.com/research">publications</a> including papers in the Journal of Politics, Political Analysis, the British Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political Studies, and Electoral Studies.</p>

<p align="justify">My dissertation is motivated by the persistence of gender differences in most stages of the political process. Across the different papers, I analyze and uncover differences between women and men in terms of (i) how group stereotypes affect their political participation, (ii) how parties differ in the responsiveness to their preferences, and (iii) how gender affects the survival in office of individual ministers. Outside of my dissertation, I have worked on a variety of substantive and methodological projects. Substantively, I have focused on party competition and attitudes toward immigration. Methodologically, my work has dealt with difficulties in the analysis of public opinion data, and the excludability assumption in studies of discrimination and bias.</p>

<p align="justify">Before coming to St. Louis, I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/index.html" target="_blank">Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a> in 2011, and obtained a Master's degree at the <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/" target="_blank">University of Essex</a> in 2013. In Spring 2018, I will be a visiting student at <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> and a pre-doctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">IQSS</a>.</p>
