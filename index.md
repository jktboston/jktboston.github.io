<p align="justify">Hi! My name Joshua Boston, and I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in Saint Louis</a>. I am most passionate about researching law and courts, primarily in the American politics subfield, but also in comparative contexts. My dissertation, broadly construed, examines the influence of judicial writing styles, especially given hierarchical constraints within the federal judicary. My committee -- Jim Spriggs (chair), Lee Epstein, and Matthew Gabel -- continues to provide me with invaluable advice and guidance. Beyond my committee, I am currently working on research projects with Betsy Sinclair, Patrick Tucker and many of my fellow graduate students, including Dave Carlson, Matt Chick, JBrandon Duck-Mayr, Jonathan Homola, S. Michelle Torres Pacheco, and Nick Waterbury.</p>
  
####  I am a political methodologist and a comparativist. My substantive research interests include party competition, representation, political behavior, the role of women in politics, and immigration. My regional areas of expertise are Western democracies and Eastern Europe. Methodologically, I am interested in Bayesian research methods, survival models, survey methodology, and causal inference. My work across these different fields has lead to multiple <a href="http://jhomola.com/research">publications</a> including papers in the Journal of Politics, Political Analysis, the British Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political Studies, and Electoral Studies.

####<p align="justify">My dissertation is motivated by the persistence of gender differences in most stages of the political process. Across the different papers, I analyze and uncover differences between women and men in terms of (i) how group stereotypes affect their political participation, (ii) how parties differ in the responsiveness to their preferences, and (iii) how gender affects the survival in office of individual ministers. Outside of my dissertation, I have worked on a variety of substantive and methodological projects. Substantively, I have focused on party competition and attitudes toward immigration. Methodologically, my work has dealt with difficulties in the analysis of public opinion data, and the excludability assumption in studies of discrimination and bias.</p>

<p align="justify">Before coming to St. Louis, I received my M.A. in political science from the University at Buffalo, where I studied and researched for three years. I worked with faculty members like Christina L. Boyd, Charles M. Lamb, Lynn Mather, and Stephen Halpern, among others. In 2010, I received my B.A. (SCL, ΦΒΚ) in interdisciplinary social sciences with concentrations in legal studies and journalism, and a minor in political science.
  
####  I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/index.html" target="_blank">Freie Universität Berlin</a> in 2011, and obtained a Master's degree at the <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/" target="_blank">University of Essex</a> in 2013. In Spring 2018, I will be a visiting student at <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> and a pre-doctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">IQSS</a>.</p>
