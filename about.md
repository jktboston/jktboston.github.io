<p align="justify">Josh and his wife, Kaitlin, were born and raised in Western New York. After living in the Buffalo-Niagara region for seven years and Saint Louis, MO for six years, we relocated to Toledo, OH in June 2019. Kaitlin is a special education teacher in the Toledo metro area. She has expertise in autism spectrum disorders and other exceptionalities. We are the proud parents of two boys and a little terrier with a lot of attitude. Our friends and family members span the country---from New York to Washington, Texas to North Carolina, and Illinois to Massachusetts. We love traveling to see loved ones. While our proudest and happiest moments are parenting our kids, we also enjoy hiking, skiing, biking, going to the beach, watching college sports, and cooking (and eating) great food.</p>
