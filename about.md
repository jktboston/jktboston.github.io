<p align="justify">Josh and his wife, Kaitlin, were born and raised in Western New York. After living in the Buffalo-Niagara region for seven years and Saint Louis, MO for six years, they relocated to Toledo, OH in June 2019. Kaitlin is a special education teacher in the Toledo metro area. She has expertise in autism spectrum disorders and other exceptionalities. Josh & Kaitlin are the proud parents of two boys and a little terrier with a lot of attitude. Our friends and family members span the country---from Texas to New York, North Carolina to Massachusetts. The Bostons love traveling to see loved ones. While parenting takes up most of Josh and Kaitlin's free time, they also enjoy hiking, skiing, biking, going to the beach, watching college sports, and cooking (and eating) great food.</p>
