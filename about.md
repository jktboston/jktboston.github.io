<p align="justify">My wife, Kaitlin, and I were born and raised in Western New York. After living in the Buffalo-Niagara region for seven years and Saint Louis, MO for six years, we relocated to Toledo, OH in June 2019. Kaitlin is a special education teacher in the Toledo metro area. She has expertise in autism spectrum disorders and other exceptionalities. We are the proud parents of three boys. Our friends and family members span the country---from New York to Washington, California to North Carolina, and Missouri to Massachusetts. We love traveling to see friends and loved ones. While our proudest and happiest moments are parenting our kids, we also enjoy hiking, skiing, biking, going to the beach, watching college sports, and cooking (and eating) great food.</p>
